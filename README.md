# Room Assignments for the Sunday River Ski Trip!
### My friend group had an upcoming ski trip to Sunday River in January 2022! We always argue over who gets to pick the bedrooms, so I thought I would try to automate the process and make it a little less personal. With the knowledge acquired from a beginner Python class, I attempted to write a function that would randomize the couples and assign them a room in the house. 

### As I continue to learn more in my advanced Python class, I hope to return to this project and update it to become more elegant.
